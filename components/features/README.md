# Feature Components

This directory contains styled components for the rustic farm aesthetic that are currently not in active use but represent significant design work. These components are maintained for potential future implementation.

## Components

### FeatureGrid & FeatureCard
A responsive grid layout for displaying major features (Restaurant, Farm, Resort) with high-quality images, descriptions, and call-to-action buttons. Features a rustic design with earth tones, subtle hover effects, and rounded corners.

### SecondaryFeatures & SecondaryFeatureCard
A two-column layout for displaying secondary features (Merchandise/Provisions, Blog/Journal) with images and detailed descriptions. Includes rustic styling with clean borders and interactive elements.

## Usage

To use these components in the main application, import them as follows:

```jsx
import FeatureGrid from '@/components/features/FeatureGrid';
import SecondaryFeatures from '@/components/features/SecondaryFeatures';

// Then in your JSX:
<FeatureGrid />
<SecondaryFeatures />
```

These components have been styled to match the overall rustic farm aesthetic of the site, with earth tones, subtle grain textures, and balanced layout.
